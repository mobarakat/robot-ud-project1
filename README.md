## Description

The purposes of that project is to create a simple world in Gazebo.

The project should implment the following:

* Build a single floor wall structure using the Building Editor tool in Gazebo. 
* Apply at least one feature, one color, and optionally one texture to your structure. 
* Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.
* Model any object of your choice using the Model Editor tool in Gazebo. Your model links should be connected with joints.
* Import your structure and two instances of your model inside an empty Gazebo World.
* Import at least one model from the Gazebo online library and implement it in your existing Gazebo world.
* Write a C++ World Plugin to interact with your world. Your code should display “Welcome to ’s World!” message as soon as you launch the Gazebo world file.
